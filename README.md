Negotiation Chatbot
Project Description
The Negotiation Chatbot is an AI-driven application designed to simulate a negotiation process between a customer and a supplier. Utilizing the OpenAI API (e.g., GPT-3.5-turbo), this chatbot can engage users in discussions about product pricing, propose counteroffers, and facilitate a dynamic negotiation experience. The chatbot leverages natural language processing to understand user inputs and respond appropriately based on a predefined pricing logic.

Features
Conversational Flow: Initiates negotiation discussions for product pricing, allowing users to accept, reject, or propose counteroffers.
Pricing Logic: Implements intelligent pricing logic where the chatbot offers discounts or counteroffers based on the user's inputs and predefined price ranges.
User Interaction: Allows users to input their desired price, and the chatbot responds by either accepting the offer, rejecting it, or proposing a counteroffer.
OpenAI Integration: Utilizes OpenAI's language models to enhance the conversational aspect of the negotiation.
Error Handling: Comprehensive error handling to manage API-related issues, including quota limits and connectivity problems.
Technologies Used
FastAPI: For building the API endpoints.
OpenAI API: For natural language processing and generating responses.
Python: The programming language used for development.
dotenv: For managing environment variables and API keys securely.
